## Key Documentation

All documentation follows the principle established in `RULES.md`:
> **With every code change, update relevant documentation.**

### For Developers
1. Start with `README.md` for project overview
2. Read `RULES.md` for development guidelines
3. Study `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
4. Follow `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for setup and workflow

### For AI Assistants
1. Always consult `RULES.md` before making changes
2. Update documentation in the same session as code changes
3. Follow the architectural patterns in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. Reference game requirements in `docs/games/*.md`

## Installation Instructions

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test on mobile (network accessible)
npm run dev:host

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Known Limitations (To Address)

- PWA icons not yet generated (need 192x192 and 512x512 PNG files)
- No actual game implementations yet (planning only)
- No tests written yet
- No CI/CD pipeline configured

## Success Metrics

### Planning Phase (COMPLETE)
- [x] All core documentation created
- [x] Architecture fully designed
- [x] Game requirements documented
- [x] Project initialized and configured
- [x] Development guidelines established

### Implementation Phase (UPCOMING)
- [ ] Both games fully functional
- [ ] Offline mode works perfectly
- [ ] PWA installable on mobile
- [ ] Statistics persist across sessions
- [ ] Adaptive learning algorithm working

### Quality Phase (FUTURE)
- [ ] Test coverage >80%
- [ ] All accessibility checks pass
- [ ] Performance budget met
- [ ] User testing complete
- [ ] Deployed and accessible

## Notes

This project emphasizes **planning before implementation**. The comprehensive documentation created ensures:

1. Clear architectural vision
2. Well-defined game requirements
3. Consistent development practices
4. Easy onboarding for new contributors
5. AI-assisted development with context

All future work should maintain this documentation-first approach as outlined in `RULES.md`.
